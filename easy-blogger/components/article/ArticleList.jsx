        content: "<p> <i>Spring</i> is the season that bridges cold, quiet months and the warmth of summer.As daylight grows longer, many plants respond by producing new leaves, buds, and blossoms. Trees that looked empty in winter begin to turn green, and gardens quickly fill with color. This change isn’t just pretty—it’s also a sign that ecosystems are waking up and becoming more active again.</p> <p> For people, spring often feels like a reset. The weather becomes more comfortable for walking, exercising, and spending time outdoors. In many places, it’s a popular time for cleaning, organizing, and starting new routines. Farmers and home gardeners prepare soil and plant seeds, taking advantage of milder temperatures and regular rainfall. Animals also adjust: birds return or migrate through, and insects reappear, helping pollinate flowers. </p><p> Spring doesn’t look the same everywhere. Some regions experience heavy rains,others get dry winds, and some barely feel a change at all. But the idea is similar: growth, movement, and a sense that something new is beginning.</p>",
